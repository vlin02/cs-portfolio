### Hello Hello!
Iâ€™m a sophomore at UCLA currently pursuing a B.S. in CS. To me, programming is all about exploration, which you may have noticed from an off-putting randomness in projects Iâ€™m involved with.

### I'm obssessed with
gaining new, completely unecessary skills! Right now Iâ€™m **deeply** invested in:
- **Learning the piano** *~ In hopes that I can someday play my [favorite tunes](/pages/music)*ðŸ¤ž
- **Speaking fluent Japanese** *~ Plans to Study Abroad TBA* ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
- **Doing the - uh - splits??** *~ It just looks â€¦ so cool!*

### When I say this 
I might sound a tad koo-koo, but I love going on long runs. Itâ€™s the scenery that keeps me going back!
