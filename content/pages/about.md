### Hello Hello!
Iâ€™m a student at UCLA currently pursuing a B.S. in CS. To me, programming is all about exploration, which you'll observe from the off-putting randomness in projects Iâ€™m involved with.

### I'm obssessed with
gaining new, completely unecessary skills! Right now Iâ€™m **deeply** invested in:
- **Learning the piano** *~ In hopes that I can someday play my [favorite tunes](/pages/music)*ðŸ¤ž
- **Speaking OK Japanese** *~ Plans to Study Abroad TBA* ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
- **Improving my flexibility** *~ Coding all day makes you really stiff!*

### When I say this 
I might sound a tad bit insane, but I love going on long runs. Itâ€™s the scenery that keeps me going back!
