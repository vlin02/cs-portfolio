### Noticed the banner ☝️?
Hopefully one of those developer jokes made any sense. Here're the explanations:
- React: [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) are one reusability feature of the framework I can't live without
- GraphQL: REST API still has its place! But GraphQL's flexibility is jaw dropping!
- AWS: Honesty, its over 200 services was intimidating when I first started!
- MongoDB: Self explanatory [pun](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/) :)
